Hi, my name is Motaz Rimawi and I'm 23 years old, Istudied Computer 
Engineering at Birzeit university.

I like to play football and tennis, I play on oud (instrumental tool).

I've participated in two bootcamps so far one was on Java and the second one 
was on Python, beside that I had an internship in front-end development 
last year.

I joined the bootcamp to learn new technologies and to get a great experience 
in order to increase my chances in getting a job in the Hi-tech fields.
